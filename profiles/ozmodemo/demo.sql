Much of the savings came from a reduction in redundant testing.</p>\n<p>The study, which ran from 2008 to 2010, involved 1,482 fully insured Humana members who sought care at 10 Milwaukee hospitals. The test group consisted of patients for whom the WHIE database was consulted during at least two ED visits; the database was not consulted for those in the control group, who also made at least two ED visits.</p>\n<p>The researchers analyzed Humana\'s claims data to determine the ED costs for patients in each group. They found there were significant decreases in costs in four of five of the top ED-based procedures, including CT scans, EKGs, laboratory testing, and radiology, when ED physicians consulted the WHIE database.</p>\n<p>An earlier study by the Medical College of Wisconsin showed that ED physicians using the WHIE data altered their workup or treatment 42 percent of the time, noted the Humana researchers. Moreover, the clinicians spent 42 percent less time gathering data than did those without access to the HIE data. And the time to the disposition decision decreased 50 percent of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"We plan to continue the collaboration between Humana and the WHIE; our study demonstrated that we gained an economic value,\" the study authors concluded. \"We found that as payers invest in HIEs, they receive a positive financial return on their investment. Although these cost-savings realized by the health plan may be used in a number of ways, one option allows health plans to invest in HIE funding, thereby improving HIE sustainability.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To learn more:<br />- see the <a href=\"http://www.ahdbonline.com/feature/business-case-payer-support-community-based-health-information-exchange-humana-pilot-evaluat\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> in American Drug &amp; Health Benefits<br />- read the <em>Healthcare IT News</em> <a href=\"http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/when-hies-are-used-health-plan-costs-go-down?topic=08,28,12,19\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Related Articles:</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/super-sized-hies-rise-nationwide/2011-08-22\" target=\"_blank\">Supersized HIEs rise up nationwide</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/new-memorial-hermann-hie-pushes-health-data-docs/2011-07-29\" target=\"_blank\">New Memorial Hermann HIE pushes health data to docs</a></p>','1314303327','13512 at http://www.fiercehealthit.com');

But, because of longstanding privacy concerns, only one state, Louisiana, has actually begun to pilot the use of an HIV registry in patient care, according to a paper in the <em>New England Journal Medicine</em>.</p>\n<p>All states but one now require laboratories to report CD4 cell counts to state health departments, and all but four states also require reporting of viral loads. This data is used for epidemiological research, not in patient care. Yet nationwide, the commentary points out, \"approximately 25 percent&nbsp;of people with HIV infection don\'t know their HIV status. Moreover, of those who are aware that they\'re infected, 50 percent&nbsp;are not receiving regular HIV care.\"</p>\n<p>The main reason for not providing the data to physicians is that public health officials fear compromising patient privacy. Some patients don\'t want their doctors to know they\'re HIV positive. And, whether patients are aware of their condition or not, the state officials in charge of building the registries are afraid they might notify the wrong patients by mistake, the authors point out.</p>\n<p>The increasing effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs, however, has strengthened the argument for releasing the data to caregivers and patients. It might it be unethical to withhold this information if it could help patients, and treating additional HIV-positive patients could reduce the spread of the disease, proponents contend.</p>\n<p>The federal Centers for Disease Control has supported release of the HIV data since 2007. Last March, it held a conference on the topic. Louisiana officials presented information on their program at the conference.</p>\n<p>Louisiana\'s Office of Public Health has created the Louisiana Public Health Information Exchange (LaPHIE) to increase the number of patients with HIV and sexually transmitted diseases under treatment. The health department is piloting the release of HIV data in Louisiana\'s state hospital system.</p>\n<p>When an authorized medical provider opens a patient\'s electronic medical record, LaPHIE alerts the caregiver if the patient is an HIV-exposed infant, or someone who has tested positive for HIV but was not informed of the results or hasn\'t received a CD4 test in the previous 12 months. A study of the program showed that that these alerts triggered phone calls to patients that resulted in 75 percent&nbsp;of HIV-positive patients returning to their doctors\' care.</p>\n<p>To learn more:<br />- read the New England Journal of Medicine <a href=\"http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=15206&amp;query=TOC\" target=\"_blank\">commentary</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Related Articles:</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.fierceemr.com/story/expanding-registry-universe-one-emr-time/2011-07-27\" target=\"_blank\">Expanding the registry universe--one EMR at a time</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/ehrs-needed-comparative-effectiveness-research-too/2011-05-28\" target=\"_blank\">EHRs needed for comparative effectiveness research, too</a></p>','1314378808','13515 at http://www.fiercehealthit.com');

Among the items of personal health information (PHI) exposed to public view were patient names, diagnosis codes, admission and discharge dates, and billing charges.</p>\n<p>Once again, this major security breach highlights the fact that misuse or loss of PHI by employees and business associates is a much bigger security risk than hacking or malicious attacks on health information systems. A report analyzing government security breach data shows that hacking was involved in only six percent of incidents in which security was compromised.</p>\n<p>In the Stanford case, a Los Angeles billing contractor named Multi-Specialty Collection Services had obtained the spreadsheet from the healthcare organization in the course of its normal operations.&nbsp;The spreadsheet&nbsp;ended up on a website called Student of Fortune, which allows students to hire people to help them with their homework.&nbsp;It&nbsp;was first posted to the site on Sept. 9, 2010, as an attachment to a question about how to construct a bar graph. Stanford apparently was unaware of the situation until a patient reported it to the hospital a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Stanford has suspended the billing contractor, launched an investigation, and is offering free identity theft protection services to affected patients, even though no social security numbers or other identifying information were on the spreadsheet. Multi-Specialty has <a href=\"http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/stanford-says-subcontractor-has-assumed-responsibility-breach?topic=18\" target=\"_blank\">assumed responsibility</a> for the breach.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the new HIPAA security rules, which are expected to be finalized in the next few months, increase the security requirements for business associates of healthcare providers. But as the Stanford incident shows, it\'s very difficult to ride herd on these business associates, regardless of what\'s in their contracts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To learn more:<br />- read the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/us/09breach.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">article</a><br />- see the <em>InformationWeek</em> <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/attacks/231601110\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a></p>\n<p><strong>Related Articles:</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/security-breaches-personal-health-information-widespread/2011-02-11\" target=\"_blank\">Security breaches of personal health information widespread</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/hit-security-worry-more-about-your-own-actions-less-about-hackers/2011-06-29\" target=\"_blank\">Internal issues are a bigger health IT security threat than hackers</a></p>','1315604128','13652 at http://www.fiercehealthit.com');

Or what if the person only did 3 months of residency and never finished? Or an M.D. going into basic research &#8211; is she still a physician or rather a scientist? The vocabulary is secondary though. The point we are tying to make in is this post is that there are a lot of physicians out there who really hang onto their degree in medicine, because so much time, money and effort were invested.

But over the years many find out that medicine as we know it is <em>not</em> what you were taught in med school. Practicing medicine is just a small part of your job, aside from bureaucracy, legal aspects, paychecks, governmental influence and so and so on. Some people start to turn away from medicine and gradually feel the urge to get out of their daily routine, escaping the windowless walls of a hospital and maybe feeling not compensated on a fair basis (at least in Europe).</p><p>Now as a physician you can&#8217;t just switch jobs. It&#8217;s not like in the business world, where you can switch industries within months. In medicine you&#8217;ll be in one industry your whole lifetime. That&#8217;s good for the patient (longtime, daily routine = quality), but it might suck for you as a physician (repetitive = boring) so it&#8217;s hard to get out and do something else. It might be a wrong observation, but there are quite some physicians out there that really consider doing something else for their living, but it&#8217;s hard to branch out. Not only from a professional point of view (no epxerience in aspects that are necessary for a business for example) but also in rather psychological terms. It&#8217;s hard to admit that being a doctor sucks. It&#8217;s frustrating, it&#8217;s not well paid and paperwork is overtaking the actual practice of medicine. Again, it&#8217;s hard to admit these things if you&#8217;ve done nothing else into your entire life, apart from having spent a lot of money on getting where you are at, but as you can see with MedCrunch &#8211; there are ways <img\nsrc=\'http://www.medcrunch.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\"icon smile I Am Not A Physician\" class=\'wp-smiley\' title=\"I Am Not A Physician photo\" /></p><p>Eventually you should only be doing things in life that you really, really enjoy. Don&#8217;t let yourself distract by social norms or the pride of your parents of you becoming a physician. It&#8217;s hard to succumb to your secure and prestigious status in society.</p><p>&#8220;Only when he enjoys, he can succeed&#8221; &#8211; &#8230;And you could be next.</p>','1309730716','http://www.medcrunch.net/?p=1478');

One of MedCrunch&#8217;s favorite topics is happiness. I guess it&#8217;s many peoples&#8217; favorite topic since it is the ultimate driver of everything we are doing. So here we go.</p><p>Today&#8217;s book was written by Katie Couric, the anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric, and is called <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Best-Advice-Ever-Got-Extraordinary/dp/0812992776/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309882457&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;The Best Advice I Ever Got&#8221;</a> (non-affiliate link). Katie invited famous and inspirational people to tell us about the best advice they ever got. There are people like Bill Cosby, Arianna Huffington, Maria Shriver, Tony Hsieh, Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Immelt, Donald Trump, Jimmy Carter, Larry King, Steven Spielberg, Michael J. Fox and many many more.</p><p>Some of the major themes of the book that characterize the stories of several contributors are: fear and how it should and must be overcome. What it means to leave a dent. True happiness. How knowing yourself is necessary to achieve flow, passion and contentment. Here are some quotes from the book:</p><blockquote><p>If you really believe in yourself and your art, then you have to create your own opportunities. You can’t wait for someone else to do it for you. &#8211; Susan Stoman -</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The best learning lesson I can give you on accomplishment is to listen. Learn how to listen. You don’t learn anything when you are talking. Think about it. &#8211; Larry King -</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As the late great Jack Lemmon once said, “Failure seldom stops you. What stops you is the fear of failure.”&#8230;.You will never achieve a deeper understanding of your work, or learn the tough lessons, if you are liked or comfortable all of the time. &#8211; Laura Linney -</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>None of us is entitled to anything. We get what we get not because we want it or we deserve it or because it’s unfair if we don’t get it but because we earn it, we respect it, and only if we share it do we keep it. &#8211; Michael J. Fox -</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The definition of success changes throughout your life. For me, the most important thing is to live with integrity, and not to give in to peer pressure. Never try to be something that you’re not. &#8211; Ellen DeGeneres -</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>André’s insight that night taught me an important lesson: misperceiving that there is one correct choice is a common mistake. Coming to understand that there are usually a few good choices—and then there’s the one you pick, commit to, and make great—is the best way to make flexible, optimal, good decisions in life. &#8211; Marissa Mayer -</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Recipes are just descriptions of one person’s take on one moment in time. They’re not rules. People think they are. They look as if they are. They say, “Do this, not this. Add this, not that.” But, really, recipes are just suggestions that got written down&#8230;.As you cook up your own life, never let anyone else’s recipe for success intimidate you or get in your way. Know your own truth, and live by it. &#8211; Mario Batali -</p></blockquote><p>These are just some examples of quotes from the book. There is much more wisdom to be found. This work is really, really rich in insights. Highly recommended read. Enjoy!</p>','1309882876','http://www.medcrunch.net/?p=1523');

Do you want to tell us a little bit about your educational and career background?</strong></p><p>I started my career in traditional fashion within academic medicine as both a clinical researcher and clinician board-certified in both Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital affiliated with The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus, Ohio where I recently earned my MPH degree in health behavior studies. I received my medical degree from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio in 2000 which was then followed by pediatric internship, residency, and then pediatric endocrinology specialty training in 2000-2006 at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas.</p><p>Being a researcher at heart, I approach clinical medicine with a mindset of problem-solving and solution evaluation. In my diabetes clinic, it was an obvious observation about the common problem of teens’ medication non-adherence and the love affair that these same teens have with SMS texting notable during the clinic visits. Reading a study using SMS texting within a pediatric <a\nhref=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/124/5/e844.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">liver transplant program</a> to improve medication adherence inspired me to do the same. I started out using a simple SMS texting protocol with my patients in a small pilot study and then developed a simple app to automate this protocol [initial publication is pending]. However, I then progressed to a more comprehensive app design based on BJ Fogg’s <a\nhref=\"http://www.behaviormodel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">health behavior change model</a> upon which my current app is based. Based on the excitement of my patients and the emerging evidence of mobile health’s clinical impact, I felt that full-time focus on my app development and its implementation process would get the app into patients’ hands faster so I decided to invest completely in my vision as a physician entrepreneur.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Could you tell us a little bit about what your research was about and what were your findings?</strong></p><p>The initial pilot study of three of my own patients assessed the effect over 3 months of a weekly SMS texting protocol personalized to each patient speaking directly from the doctor to the patient. Health outcomes improved: hgbA1C levels dropped from 11% to 9% and adherence to meal insulin boluses improved 3-4 fold after the first 3 months. The successful SMS texting pilot study was featured on <a\nhref=\"http://www.cbc.ca/whitecoat/communication/2010/10/01/social-medicine/ \" target=\"_blank\">CBC’s White Coat Black Art Show </a>, <a\nhref=\"http://www.10tv.com/live/content/video/10tv.html?video=1167184 and http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/aug/12/high-tech-house-call-01362-vi-18537/\" target=\"_blank\">NPR, local television news </a>, <a\nhref=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxColumbus-Jennifer-Shine-Dye\" target=\"_blank\">TEDx Columbus</a> 2010, <a\nhref=\"http://mobihealthnews.com/8599/texting-imrpoves-type-1-diabetes-adherence/ \" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Health News</a>, <a\nhref=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2010/09/06/prl20906.htm\" target=\"_blank\">American Medical News</a>, and <a\nhref=\"http://www.endocrinetoday.com/view.aspx?rid=70442\" target=\"_blank\">Endocrine Today</a>. However, I began to observe that the initial adherence improvement started to disappear after about 6 months among the initial pilot study population before the personalized automation app programming was completed.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: So you came up with your first app to solve that problem. Right?</strong></p><p>I hypothesized that although the SMS texting protocol I used was providing reminders or triggers, the patients still needed more. Per BJ Fogg’s <a\nhref=\"http://www.behaviormodel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">behavior change model</a>, three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Trigger. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing. My initial SMS texting protocol was only using triggers. Therefore, I am now working in partnership with an Ohio health <a\nhref=\"http://www.duethealth.com \" target=\"_blank\">mobile app developer</a> on the completion of a very exciting diabetes app based on BJ Fogg’s health behaviors model targeting improvement in daily glucose checks which I recently discussed at <a\nhref=\"http://mobilehealth.org/speakers/jennifer-dyer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford’s Mobile Health Meeting </a>‘What Really Works’ in May 2011.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Please tell us about your current project. What’s your company called? What’s the product and how does it work?</strong></p><p>As an independent consultant with my own company EndoGoddess LLC, I am working with Ohio health mobile app developer <a\nhref=\"http://www.duethealth.com \" target=\"_blank\">DuetHealth</a> of eProximiti on designing and implementing the above app as well as designing and implementing new apps for clients. In other words, DuetHealth creates apps for clients (health systems, doctors’ offices, insurance agencies) that connect patients with their doctors while providing quality information and/or motivational strategies as requested for specific disease processes. Because the software platform is based on the doctor-patient relationship, which is also the foundation of good quality healthcare, the company software is named ‘duet’. The diabetes app product is called ‘Duet EndoGoddess’ which will be available in August on iTunes. The app targets glucose checking 4 times per day as the desired behavior. Patients can plug their glucometers into their smartphone using a USB cord (the same equipment that they use to download their meters on their home computer). They will receive iTunes points monthly for purchasing songs based on their achievement of daily glucose checks which serves as a rewards feedback loop to promote daily glucose checks and consequently improved insulin adherence and diabetes control. We are speaking to several large insurance agencies for testing the app in a large population. The app also provides additional daily motivational graphics, targeted real-time notification of glucoses to desired recipients, original educational content and videos, text reminders featuring clinical goals for diabetes care between visits, and the ability to securely text the physician and members of a designated social network.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Can you tell us a little bit about your revenue model? How will you make money with the app?</strong></p><p>The app will be a free download. The money to pay for iTunes points will come from the patient’s designated support network [friends, family] who are willing to sponsor the patient for the year. The idea is similar to how charities such as the Susan G Komen race participants are sponsored by their friends and family to earn money for breast cancer research. According to the patient’s preference, a monthly progress report can be sent to their sponsors so that they can encourage and reward the patient for their hard work checking their blood sugars daily. It is our hope that insurance agencies and/or advertisers will see the value in the app’s ability to create better health and to prevent complications with diabetes thereby sustaining the revenue model long-term. As with most internet start-up companies, the primary monetary value is within the equity of the company and its ability to solve problems that then leads to investments by venture capitalists thereby allowing the company to grow and spread its value commercially. As <a\nhref=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/06/diabetes?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/dc/sugarrush\" target=\"_blank\">diabetes has increased worldwide </a>over the past 30 years, long-term solutions are critical.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: So considering the fact that you actually researched this topic, would it be correct to say that yours is one of the first evidence based apps out there?</strong></p><p>The idea is not new, but the implementation and execution to this level in diabetes and mHealth is new. There are a lot of apps for diabetes available in the app store but none that I am aware of that directly connect the patient and the doctor and their glucometer and a designated social network.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: The social part is especially interesting about your business model. You will need a lot of buy-in from all the stakeholders: patients, doctors, relatives, insurance companies. How are you going to get this?</strong></p><p>As you know, consumers already love mobile, and <a\nhref=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/flurry-time-spent-on-mobile-apps-has-surpassed-web-browsing/\" target=\"_blank\">apps are now used more than internet browsing</a>. Doctors really like mobile too. In fact, <a\nhref=\"http://bit.ly/m8gvEH\" target=\"_blank\">doctors are heavy tech users</a> – early adopters for healthcare technology. In the wake of ACA healthcare reform and payment restructure that penalizes hospital readmissions, insurance companies and hospital systems are rewarding affordable and impactful innovations in quality healthcare such as mobile health. We have already received a lot of interest from insurance companies in using and testing our apps, and have implemented our f<a\nhref=\"http://ow.ly/4zwFQ\" target=\"_blank\">irst duet module </a>at Ohio Health Hospital System in obstetrics with a lot of excitement amongst all parties. I feel that the future is bright for the doctor-patient relationship and its mobile extension!</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Are you the sole founder of your company or do you have partners?</strong></p><p>As an independent consultant, I am the sole founder of my company EndoGoddess LLC. I own a share of intellectual property in the Duet EndoGoddess diabetes app.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Do you already have funding?</strong></p><p>I have invested my personal savings to start my business and to make the transition from academics to entrepreneurship. Otherwise, I receive income from my primary client DuetHealth and am speaking to several other potential clients for further consulting work in healthcare social media.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: You are an avid user of Twitter. Can you explain your Twitter use-case to us? How are you making use of it?</strong></p><p>I also actively engage and speak nationally about healthcare social media including at the recent South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference in March 2011. I am known to many on twitter as @EndoGoddess and have a youtube channel which I use primarily for advocacy. I maintain social boundaries by using the same standards of professionalism followed by generations of doctors before the advent of the internet. I feel that ‘good health is social’ and that social media provides opportunities for physicians to connect people with authentic improvements in their wellbeing and health which far outweigh the easily-managed perceived risks.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: With all these distractions…Twitter, e-mail, Facebook and so forth, do you think social media is making people less happy, happier or do they have no influence on happiness levels – what do you think?</strong></p><p>For me, social media connects me with the reason that I became a doctor: patients. Helping patients empower themselves with knowledge and live their best lives is an absolute honor that gives me great happiness. As will all things, balance is key, and I do recommend taking periodic ‘digital vacations’ to assure that balance…this really works for me.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Before the interview, you told us that you are doing social media consulting. Could you tell us a little more about it?</strong></p><p>The primary part of my healthcare social media consulting involves advocacy and speaking at meetings.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: What is the best advice you got from a mentor or friend?</strong></p><p>Dream it then do it.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Thank you so much for your time!</strong></p><hr\n/><p><strong>Jennifer Shine Dyer, MD, MPH </strong>is a mobile health physician entrepreneur and consultant.

They act as the communicational backbone and make sure that the people who are supposed to be on the same page are on the same page. Now there are certainly flaws to existing systems, otherwise the old fashioned e-mail wouldn&#8217;t exist as the primary form of communication. These software applications enhance internal corporate communication, facilitate workflows between different teams and create a sense of corporate identity. We are big fans of those fancy web applications with staggering valuations, big rounds of funding and superstar founders and thus we&#8217;ve looked into some web applications that could find their way into a modern hospital environment. This is the first in a series of posts on collaboration tools. Stay tuned for more good stuff to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a\ntitle=\"Yammer\" href=\"https://www.yammer.com/\"><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-1574 alignleft\" title=\"How To Collaborate in Hospitals   A Use Case for Yammer photo\" src=\"http://www.medcrunch.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/621707_yammer_logo.png\" alt=\"621707 yammer logo How To Collaborate in Hospitals   A Use Case for Yammer\" width=\"200\" height=\"68\" /></a></p><p><a\ntitle=\"Yammer\" href=\"https://www.yammer.com/\">Yammer</a> was coined the &#8220;<a\ntitle=\"Twitter for Companies\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2008/09/08/yammer-launches-at-tc50-twitter-for-companies/\">Twitter for Companies</a>&#8220;. It was launched a couple of years ago by seriel entrpreneur and movie producer <a\ntitle=\"David O Sacks\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks\">David O. Sacks</a> in the Silicon Valley, with the aim to build a web-based tool for internal communication in startups, SMBs and cooperations. Yammer is really powerful. It comes with a variety of mobile applications and a sound web interface, that let&#8217;s you manage yourself and your co-workers in groups, send direct messages and follow each other &#8211; much like Twitter.</p><p>The basic structure &#8211; it&#8217;s logic &#8211; is very similar to Twitter. In comparison to Facebook, Twitter is open, it&#8217;s not a walled garden. The &#8220;following&#8221; concept is more vague than the &#8220;be-friending&#8221; concept. Twitter allows you to follow people whom you do not know. Twitter is also better suited for sharing work-realted and professional information than Facebook, which was originally conceived to exchange personal information between friends. Imagine following the top-notch breast surgeon in the hospital you work at. Chances are high you don&#8217;t know her personally and she has no clue who you are, but what if she&#8217;d share valuable information on the latest insights in breast cancer reserach. She would share information you would be usually looking up in some journal or to be honest you might not even look it up and it might just pass you by.</p><p>An application such as Yammer solves this by connecting the unconnected. By following peers and certain people you&#8217;ll obtain knowledge and insights that you probably didn&#8217;t even know existed. A medical, multi-disciplinary approach, as medicine is being taught in med school, yet as it fails to be practiced in daily routine. Where specialists of all walks contribute their experience to a singular activity feed that anybody in the hospital environment can follow, react to and share with others. That&#8217;s social networking at its best, yet hardly anybody is doing it.</p><p>As with every good story in life, a similar, yet mor action-esque story took place <a\ntitle=\"Twitter in Greys Anatomy\" href=\"http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2011/02/027793.htm\">in a recent episode of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</a>. They were texting live status updates from the OR to another hospital and other medical professionals with the intention to document a live operation for othters to learn from. Eventually there were problems during the procedure and a life-saving-tweet from another professional saved the patient&#8217;s life. Well, this is Hollywood but not that unlikely after all &#8211; we think.</p><p>While Twitter has its limitations with respect to security, Yammer doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s secure, scalable and highly customizable. Yammer for your research group? Yammer for the OR? Yammer for your ward? No problem for Yammer. To clarify things here. We are not affiliated with Yammer or paid by them, it&#8217;s simple and we are not aware of a comparable, modern and efficient alternative to their service. Surely there are the SAPs, Siemens and others on the planet that offer such services for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but Yammer costs <del>1$ per user</del> $5/user/month. That&#8217;s fair and an understandable pricing model.</p><p>We&#8217;d really like to see a hospital, or a ward, giving Yammer a try. Crossing the border of traditional communication and aiming for an alternate and potentially higher form of communication through the means of technology. What do you think about this matter? We would love to hear your ideas in the comments section.</p>','1310460040','http://www.medcrunch.net/?p=1573');

Diller, now 69, was said to excessively, make use of a concept known as &#8220;reverse mentoring&#8221;. As the title suggests, the idea is that the typically younger, less experienced person, who has knowledge in a particula area, gives advice to the more senior person. This works amazingly well in a setup with an executive such as Barry Diller. Jack Welch, Management-Guru und CEO of GE is also known for using a reverse mentored decision process.</p><p>He, the experience business person, with a track record in print publishing is being told that the company needs to move towards the internet to be sucessful. By asking the modern customer, the young, internet-savvy users, he gets insight into the market he wants to enter. It&#8217;s a great and simple concept as long as the senior to-be-mentored person shows humblness and willingness to learn from a less experienced person, which makes this more of a psychological obstacle, then an organizational one.</p><p>Does reverse mentoring have its raison d&#8217;être also in medicine?

Search companies like Google, in the business of providing the best search possible, like ways they can gauge the influence of content they index. Instead of pulling up content based on the most keywords or links similar to the query, they can filter out the more important content –that created by real influencers on the topic within the social internet. Businesses known as social ranking sites are compiling competitive rating systems with the ultimate goal of creating a number for influencers on particular topics. Ultimately, your number will be compared and contrasted to the numbers of other participants in the social sphere and count towards ratings that might be used for everything from ranking you on consumer sites like Amazon.com… to you and your businesses position in search engine rankings.</p><p>Why should you care? In the future it is probable that your social score will be available to everyone from banks to vendors. You will be able to learn things about the people you interview before you hire them and you better believe potential patients will look at it before deciding whether or not to patronize your business.</p><p>Remember when the most valuable currency on the internet was the domain name?</p><p>The social score is next.</p><p>The people involved early in the social internet will be the first to benefit. High social scores will be sought as will people who hold them. A corporation might seek out individuals with high social scores within their verticals with offers to promote products – a next-generation evolution of the Google Adsense concept.</p><p>The leader in calculating social influence, a website called <a\ntitle=\"Klout\" href=\"http://www.klout.com\">Klout.com</a> began integrating it’s “klout” ratings with data it compiled from Facebook in order to get a fuller picture of one’s efforts within the social sphere. It’s not done either – watch as they interface with LinkedIn, YouTube and a host of other popular social platforms to increase their influence as the leader in rating individuals social influence.</p><p>. . . and the first place “Klout” will be important is your search engine ranking.

We are not speaking of the medical profession obviosuly but from all these things that you, as a human being in the civilized world are surrounded with. In med school and as a physician you are acting in a walled and exclusive garden. Why &#8220;exclusive&#8221; and &#8220;walled&#8221; you might ask, but let us explain this.</p><p>Do you think the average physician has any clue how the healthcare system really <em>works</em>? In our experience they don&#8217;t. Neither in med school, nor in residency you learn how the system is set up. How is the price of a drug being calculated? Who owns the hospital you are working at? Who pays your bills?</p><p>Obviously there are harsh differences between the US (private) and Europe (public) in terms of these questions but that doesn&#8217;t matter for this post. The argument we are posing referrs to the individual, not to the system. The question is, do <strong>YOU </strong>know anything about the system you are working in? But let&#8217;s take a step back. Have you ever learned anything about the economic and legal basics of life in med school? How do insurances work? What&#8217;s the best way to finance your car?</p><p>We agree, that this is not a problem of medicine alone, but also has its presence in other walks such as physics or software development. If you ever plan to open up your own office then you&#8217;ll ultimately will have to deal with these things. With loans, with banks, with insurances, with salespeople, with pharma reps and the list goes on forever.</p><p>One thing that is absurdedly not being taught in med school is <a\ntitle=\"How to treat pharmaceutical companies\" href=\"http://www.medcrunch.net/pharma-marketing-101-two-things-pharma-needs-from-you/\">how to treat pharmaceutical companies</a>. The pharma industry is by far the biggest &#8220;sparring partner&#8221; of the modern physician, yet we are never thaught how to interpret their sales material. We are wow&#8217;ed by fancy presentations, hockey stick survival rate charts and beautiful print folders, but although we were taught to question science and its results, we were never taught  how to interpret results being presented by pharma companies and how to interact with sales people.</p><p>Yet these things are vital. They are as important as knowing the current guidelines in your respective field of work. Understanding the system you are working in, allows you to question it and eventually also to tweak it. There&#8217;s a saying that goes like this: &#8220;Those who do not know, must believe&#8221;. And this is definitely also true for medicine and healthcare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>','1311617851','http://www.medcrunch.net/?p=1583');

Apart from the obvious (negative) health implications, it is much less socially accepted than in <a\nhref=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtMfzasLbu8\" target=\"_blank\">the golden days</a>. Now there are great minds out there that see great opportunities, but it&#8217;s uncommon that you stumble upon a company that aims to re-invent smoking. &#8220;Re-inventing&#8221; is somewhat of an oxymoron. It simply doesn&#8217;t fit in our minds and seems so wrong especially when it has to do with something that harmful. There are two major reasons why cigarettes (for the sake of simplicity and correlation of worldwide usage let&#8217;s leave out pipes, sishas et al.) have been (and still are in some parts of the world) such a tremendously successful product.</p><p>1. They are highly addictive</p><p>2. They were widely regarded as something &#8220;cool&#8221; (mostly through the entertainment industy)</p><p>Being addicted and killing yourself isn&#8217;t something worth striving for &#8211; being &#8220;cool&#8221;, however, is  for a lot of people, especially young ones. Now what if you could eliminate the &#8220;health part&#8221; of the whole smoking paradigma? Plenty of companies, entrepreneurs and chemists have tried to do so, but largely failed. Part of the reason is that the &#8220;cool&#8221; part has been neglected. It&#8217;s hard to imagine Jon Hamm in Mad Men smoking an electronic cigarette. It&#8217;s not authentic, it&#8217;s fake, it&#8217;s not cool.</p><p>Step into <a\ntitle=\"Ploom\" href=\"http://www.ploom.com\" target=\"_blank\">PLOOM</a> - a blend of <a\ntitle=\"Nespresso\" href=\"http://www.nespresso.com/\">Nespresso</a> and Cigarettes:</p><blockquote><p>Ploom began as a conversation between a smoker and a non-smoker outside a studio at Stanford’s Joint Program in Design in 2004.</p><p>&#8220;What do you hate about smoking?&#8221; Adam asked.<br\n/> &#8220;What do you love about it?&#8221; James responded.</p><p>The two had already been collaborating on eccentric thesis explorations but those were quickly dropped to answer the question: What if smoking were reinvented today? The thesis generated support from some of the most well respected thinkers and doers in and around the University. James and Adam founded Ploom in a tiny orange painted room on an apple orchard in Palo Alto, determined to bring a better alternative to people who love (and hate) smoking. Hundreds of prototypes, consumer insights and a business plan later, the two developed a unique startup in the historic Dogpatch area of San Francisco with a handful of the best engineers, advisors, marketing and biotech veterans in the country. The model One and Ploom’s first six flavors are the first glimpse of the future of smoking: a new ritual for a modern society from a new kind of company.</p></blockquote><p>Ploom is a company that takes into account that smoking has been a social habit for thousands of years. It&#8217;s always been there, and before modern medicine has stepped in, it also hadn&#8217;t been regarded as something bad or unhealthy. The San Francisco based startup doesn&#8217;t aim to offer an alternative for the modern nicotine addict, but rather offers a viable, <a\ntitle=\"Ploom FAQ\" href=\"http://ploom.com/faq.html\" target=\"_blank\">harmless</a> and cool smoking device. Why not smoke if it doesn&#8217;t harm your body, doesn&#8217;t affect your surrounding and doesn&#8217;t make your clothes smell? What if the aspartam in diet coke was more health-threatening than a cigarette?</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://www.medcrunch.net/smoking-beautifuland-harmless/\"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p><p>The endavour of the two founders Adam and James is an ambitious one, but it&#8217;s simply amazing that in the eco-friendly, Toyota Prius® covered Dogpatch area of San Francisco somebody really wants to make smoking cool again. That&#8217;s pure &#8220;out of the box&#8221; and we love it.</p><p>Things like this likely come out of something we one day call <a\ntitle=\"Media Lab of HealthCare\" href=\"http://33charts.com/2011/08/mit-media-lab-health.html\">Tbe Media Lab of Healthcare</a></p><p>Hat tip from <a\ntitle=\"Thomas Goetz on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tgoetz\">Thomas Goetz</a></p>','1313069724','http://www.medcrunch.net/?p=1673');

Why would you give up the reputation, a good salary and being paid for saving peoples lives?

You tell your spouse or best friend and usually they&#8217;ll flip out. Interestingly, you won&#8217;t see the same irritated faces if you had studied business and wanted to leave accounting or even law and wanted to quit being an attorney &#8211; but that&#8217;s another matter. People expect you to be working in the field of work you were educated in &#8211; and that&#8217;s not good. In most European countries you have to decide which education you want to pursue at the age of 18. Seriously, at the age of 18, where you have drinks, fun and girls or guys in mind, you have to think about such a crucial and long-lasting decision &#8211; that&#8217;s ridiculous. With the American college and grad-school system in education the &#8220;point of no return&#8221; gets pushed back some years, yet still it doesn&#8217;t solve the basic problem of (too) early decisions. When you start going to med school you probably have a certain picture in mind of what a doctor does. Of what medicine entails and what the ramifications of med school are. Statistically your dad or mom is a physician. If you eventually decide to pursue a medical career, during the first several years (typically pre-med), NO-BO-DY never, ever actually tells you what it&#8217;s like to work in a hospital (i.e., what it feels like). You study the basics of chemistry and pathophysiology, but you&#8217;ll never hear about work hours, compensation and how the insurance system works.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a rant against medical school or being a physician. It&#8217;s rather supposed to be tiny pamphlet that deciding too early in your life what you want to do for the rest of it might not be very wise. It&#8217;s also important to always remember that it&#8217;s never to late to switch. This sounds cheesy, but it&#8217;s true.</p><p>A colleague of ours went to med school, then went into pharma until he became medical director of a big pharma company and then decided to start a residency in oncology. It may look awkward starting your residency at the age of 45, but this guy knew everything about the pharma business. He was able to pull in research money easily, he knew a lot about clinical trials, about governmental limitations, transnational studies and epidemiology. His expertise must have been great for the other residents there. We love such &#8220;against the current&#8221; people and careers. Such people change industries, act as role models and usually have radically different views and opinions compared to the ones who stayed at the exact same job for the last 15 years or more.</p><p>If you believe you are one of them, then go ahead and read why you might be <a\ntitle=\"Underestimating your options as a doctor\" href=\"http://www.medcrunch.net/doctors-underestimate-options/\">underestimating your options</a>.</p>','1313519461','http://www.medcrunch.net/?p=1513');

The enhanced access to test results is designed to bypass laws in several states that require patients to get the data from their physicians.</p>\n<p>The proposed rules would amend the patient privacy provisions of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

The new amendment explicitly states that the patient is an authorized person under federal law.</p>\n<p>\"We believe that the advent of certain health reform concepts [for example, individualized medicine and an individual\'s active involvement in his or her own healthcare] would be best served by revisiting the CLIA limitations on the disclosure of laboratory test results,\" the notice of proposed rulemaking states.</p>\n<p>The HIPAA privacy rule also impedes the ability of individuals to obtain their own test results.

We&#8217;ve also argued to some extent the model is dead. Pharma reps are expensive and pharma has transitioned into a sales business, rather than a research-driven business (some would argue that it has always been that way). The model of a pharmaceutical representative that visits the doc frequently and informs/pitches the physician about the drug is salesy and pushy. But what doctors really need is a partner. The company that produces the drug should know best about the drug. About it&#8217;s real efficacy, its side effects and its off- and on-label use. The rep should be a person the doctor can call anytime and ask questions he doesn&#8217;t find in the package leaflet. But although pharamceutical companies try do to so, many doctors still bolt when they see a pharma rep approaching. Not another brochure, not another free pen, not another salesman that wants me to prescribe more of the drug.</p><p>Now something called eDetailing has emerged over the past years. The idea is to bring old-fashioned drug brochures to life with multimedia presentations that are being distributed via e-mail or newsletter. Another approach is so-called TeleDetailing, where the acutual sales rep is behind a computer and hooks up with the doc over a video conferencing tool. Now this is primarly due to cost-cutting efforts of pharmaceutical companies, but they also envision to bring a closer and long lasting relationship with the physician.</p><p>Having a personal visit from a rep though shows that the doctor is being treated as important, that the company cares about her and takes time. On the other hand it can be time consuming, inefficient and repetitive.</p><p>Eventually there must be something in between. We do not have an answer and a lot of smart people out there have already put a lot of thought into this, but what&#8217;s really the best way that a pharma company approaches and pitches doctors without being annoying? It&#8217;s certainly handy to pull up a nifty flash animation that gives you all the background information about a drug, but it&#8217;s certainly also nice to have a person visiting you over decades, a person that accompanies your life as a physician.</p><p>Our guess is that in the long run there will be a distinction between physicians. This is already happening but not to such an obvious extent. Important physicians (so-called KOLs alias Key Opinion Leaders) will always be visited by real people. Young residents that hustle through the corridors with little income will likely be contact via digital channels. But the goal must be to access the doctor in a pull &#8211; and not a push &#8211; way. Meaning that the doctor should make use of a service or product that helps her in her daily clinical routine (i.e., physicians should ideally be the ones who &#8220;pull&#8221; the information from the pharma company). Pharma should start building products (possibly also outside of the pharma arena like apps, web-services etc.) that <em>help </em>physicians AND sales reps do their jobs.</p>','1315954196','http://www.medcrunch.net/?p=1715');

Essentially a series of project management timelines for large providers, small providers, payers, and vendors, these widgets can be printed out as PDFs, downloaded to a desktop or mobile device, or shared via websites.</p>\n<p>While the timelines start where providers should have been on Jan. 1, 2011, they also include goals for three months, two months, and one month before the 5010 deadline. Of course, unless a hospital or a practice has already completed internal testing and started external testing by now, it is behind on that timeline.</p>\n<p>Under the ICD-10 plan, CMS envisions that by early next year, healthcare systems will begin training their staffs and be ready to start internal testing. They are supposed to start external testing in fall 2012. The following spring, CMS says, they should conduct intensive training for their coders. In summer 2013, they should complete external testing and begin the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 so they\'ll be ready to switch over entirely to ICD-10 by October.</p>\n<p>CMS also has&nbsp;taken a couple of other steps to prepare for these major administrative changes.

While patients can be asymptomatic, many experience a wide variety of symptoms, including palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, angina, and decompensated heart failure. In addition, atrial fibrillation can be associated with hemodynamic dysfunction, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and systemic thromboembolism. Initial evaluation of the patient with new-onset atrial fibrillation should focus on the patient\'s hemodynamic stability. An effort should also be made to evaluate for potential comorbid diseases that contribute to initiation or maintenance of atrial fibrillation. Immediate electrical cardioversion should be considered for patients with hemodynamic collapse or evidence of cardiac ischemia.The management of atrial fibrillation can be broken down into management of new-onset and long-standing atrial fibrillation. The cornerstones of new-onset atrial fibrillation management are rate control and anticoagulation. The clinical decision to use a rhythm control or rate control strategy requires integration of several factors, including degree of symptoms, likelihood of successful cardioversion and presence of comorbidities. Anticoagulation is an important consideration in both new onset and long-standing atrial fibrillation.','Data from the Framingham heart study show that atrial fibrillation is associated with a 1.5- to 1.9-fold higher risk of death, which is in part due to the strong association between atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic events.

But, because of longstanding privacy concerns, only one state, Louisiana, has actually begun to pilot the use of an HIV registry in patient care, according to a paper in the <em>New England Journal Medicine</em>.</p>\n<p>All states but one now require laboratories to report CD4 cell counts to state health departments, and all but four states also require reporting of viral loads. This data is used for epidemiological research, not in patient care. Yet nationwide, the commentary points out, \"approximately 25 percent&nbsp;of people with HIV infection don\'t know their HIV status. Moreover, of those who are aware that they\'re infected, 50 percent&nbsp;are not receiving regular HIV care.\"</p>\n<p>The main reason for not providing the data to physicians is that public health officials fear compromising patient privacy. Some patients don\'t want their doctors to know they\'re HIV positive. And, whether patients are aware of their condition or not, the state officials in charge of building the registries are afraid they might notify the wrong patients by mistake, the authors point out.</p>\n<p>The increasing effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs, however, has strengthened the argument for releasing the data to caregivers and patients. It might it be unethical to withhold this information if it could help patients, and treating additional HIV-positive patients could reduce the spread of the disease, proponents contend.</p>\n<p>The federal Centers for Disease Control has supported release of the HIV data since 2007. Last March, it held a conference on the topic. Louisiana officials presented information on their program at the conference.</p>\n<p>Louisiana\'s Office of Public Health has created the Louisiana Public Health Information Exchange (LaPHIE) to increase the number of patients with HIV and sexually transmitted diseases under treatment. The health department is piloting the release of HIV data in Louisiana\'s state hospital system.</p>\n<p>When an authorized medical provider opens a patient\'s electronic medical record, LaPHIE alerts the caregiver if the patient is an HIV-exposed infant, or someone who has tested positive for HIV but was not informed of the results or hasn\'t received a CD4 test in the previous 12 months. A study of the program showed that that these alerts triggered phone calls to patients that resulted in 75 percent&nbsp;of HIV-positive patients returning to their doctors\' care.</p>\n<p>To learn more:<br />- read the New England Journal of Medicine <a href=\"http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=15206&amp;query=TOC\" target=\"_blank\">commentary</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Related Articles:</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.fierceemr.com/story/expanding-registry-universe-one-emr-time/2011-07-27\" target=\"_blank\">Expanding the registry universe--one EMR at a time</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/ehrs-needed-comparative-effectiveness-research-too/2011-05-28\" target=\"_blank\">EHRs needed for comparative effectiveness research, too</a></p>','<p>The public health establishment is beginning to recognize the value of using state HIV registries to bring HIV-positive patients under the care of a physician, or return them to care after they\'ve dropped out.

This question seems trivial yet, at least for physicians reading this blog, the answer might not be as straightforward as it seems at first.</p><p>For physicians having their own office or working in the hospital it&#8217;s pretty pretty pretty clear, as <a title=\"Larry David\" href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm\" target=\"_blank\">Larry David</a> would have said. Working as a physician on a daily, clinical basis you are probably going to be treated as a physician and <em>feel</em> as a physician. If you have a dual degree in medicine and economics, such as an MBA, working for a pharmaceutical company, a case that is hardly unusual by the way, the situation becomes more complex. Clearly, you went to med school, worked in a hospital have your M.D. on your business card &#8211; but <em>are</em> you a physician and even more importantly do you <em>feel</em> like a physician?</p><p>Whether you are a physician or you are not is not an easy question to answer. There is a really fine line in this whole game. Would you call somebody a physician who &#8220;just&#8221; finished Med School, but didn&#8217;t do residency? Or what if the person only did 3 months of residency and never finished? Or an M.D. going into basic research &#8211; is she still a physician or rather a scientist? The vocabulary is secondary though. The point we are tying to make in is this post is that there are a lot of physicians out there who really hang onto their degree in medicine, because so much time, money and effort were invested. But what if you start loosing interest in clinical medicine? It&#8217;s simply hard to admit to yourself because of the reasons mentioned above: time * money * effort = a lot of lifetime.</p><p>These are simple and pithy examples, yet we believe that there are some reasons why this distinction for physicians specifically even evolves. In the beginning of your career and even earlier in medical school, medicine has something mesmerizing. It&#8217;s cool and you&#8217;ll be highly respected if you are going into medicine. But over the years many find out that medicine as we know it is <em>not</em> what you were taught in med school. Practicing medicine is just a small part of your job, aside from bureaucracy, legal aspects, paychecks, governmental influence and so and so on. Some people start to turn away from medicine and gradually feel the urge to get out of their daily routine, escaping the windowless walls of a hospital and maybe feeling not compensated on a fair basis (at least in Europe).</p><p>Now as a physician you can&#8217;t just switch jobs. It&#8217;s not like in the business world, where you can switch industries within months. In medicine you&#8217;ll be in one industry your whole lifetime. That&#8217;s good for the patient (longtime, daily routine = quality), but it might suck for you as a physician (repetitive = boring) so it&#8217;s hard to get out and do something else. It might be a wrong observation, but there are quite some physicians out there that really consider doing something else for their living, but it&#8217;s hard to branch out. Not only from a professional point of view (no epxerience in aspects that are necessary for a business for example) but also in rather psychological terms. It&#8217;s hard to admit that being a doctor sucks. It&#8217;s frustrating, it&#8217;s not well paid and paperwork is overtaking the actual practice of medicine. Again, it&#8217;s hard to admit these things if you&#8217;ve done nothing else into your entire life, apart from having spent a lot of money on getting where you are at, but as you can see with MedCrunch &#8211; there are ways </p><p>Eventually you should only be doing things in life that you really, really enjoy.

There are people like Bill Cosby, Arianna Huffington, Maria Shriver, Tony Hsieh, Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Immelt, Donald Trump, Jimmy Carter, Larry King, Steven Spielberg, Michael J. Fox and many many more.</p><p>Some of the major themes of the book that characterize the stories of several contributors are: fear and how it should and must be overcome. What it means to leave a dent. True happiness. How knowing yourself is necessary to achieve flow, passion and contentment. Here are some quotes from the book:</p><p>If you really believe in yourself and your art, then you have to create your own opportunities. You can’t wait for someone else to do it for you. &#8211; Susan Stoman -</p><p>The best learning lesson I can give you on accomplishment is to listen. Learn how to listen. You don’t learn anything when you are talking. Think about it. &#8211; Larry King -</p><p>As the late great Jack Lemmon once said, “Failure seldom stops you. What stops you is the fear of failure.”&#8230;.You will never achieve a deeper understanding of your work, or learn the tough lessons, if you are liked or comfortable all of the time. &#8211; Laura Linney -</p><p>None of us is entitled to anything. We get what we get not because we want it or we deserve it or because it’s unfair if we don’t get it but because we earn it, we respect it, and only if we share it do we keep it. &#8211; Michael J. Fox -</p><p>The definition of success changes throughout your life. For me, the most important thing is to live with integrity, and not to give in to peer pressure. Never try to be something that you’re not. &#8211; Ellen DeGeneres -</p><p>André’s insight that night taught me an important lesson: misperceiving that there is one correct choice is a common mistake. Coming to understand that there are usually a few good choices—and then there’s the one you pick, commit to, and make great—is the best way to make flexible, optimal, good decisions in life. &#8211; Marissa Mayer -</p><p>Recipes are just descriptions of one person’s take on one moment in time. They’re not rules. People think they are. They look as if they are. They say, “Do this, not this. Add this, not that.” But, really, recipes are just suggestions that got written down&#8230;.As you cook up your own life, never let anyone else’s recipe for success intimidate you or get in your way. Know your own truth, and live by it. &#8211; Mario Batali -</p><p>These are just some examples of quotes from the book. There is much more wisdom to be found. This work is really, really rich in insights. Highly recommended read.

INSERT INTO `node_revisions` VALUES ('38269','38269','0','How Entrepreneurship Can Improve Health – Interview with Jen Dyer: Startup Founder, Pediatrician & Social Media Advocate.','<p></p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Jen, you recently left clinical medicine to become a tech entrepreneur. Do you want to tell us a little bit about your educational and career background?</strong></p><p>I started my career in traditional fashion within academic medicine as both a clinical researcher and clinician board-certified in both Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital affiliated with The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus, Ohio where I recently earned my MPH degree in health behavior studies. I received my medical degree from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio in 2000 which was then followed by pediatric internship, residency, and then pediatric endocrinology specialty training in 2000-2006 at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas.</p><p>Being a researcher at heart, I approach clinical medicine with a mindset of problem-solving and solution evaluation. In my diabetes clinic, it was an obvious observation about the common problem of teens’ medication non-adherence and the love affair that these same teens have with SMS texting notable during the clinic visits. Reading a study using SMS texting within a pediatric <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/124/5/e844.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">liver transplant program</a> to improve medication adherence inspired me to do the same. I started out using a simple SMS texting protocol with my patients in a small pilot study and then developed a simple app to automate this protocol [initial publication is pending]. However, I then progressed to a more comprehensive app design based on BJ Fogg’s <a href=\"http://www.behaviormodel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">health behavior change model</a> upon which my current app is based. Based on the excitement of my patients and the emerging evidence of mobile health’s clinical impact, I felt that full-time focus on my app development and its implementation process would get the app into patients’ hands faster so I decided to invest completely in my vision as a physician entrepreneur.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Could you tell us a little bit about what your research was about and what were your findings?</strong></p><p>The initial pilot study of three of my own patients assessed the effect over 3 months of a weekly SMS texting protocol personalized to each patient speaking directly from the doctor to the patient. Health outcomes improved: hgbA1C levels dropped from 11% to 9% and adherence to meal insulin boluses improved 3-4 fold after the first 3 months. The successful SMS texting pilot study was featured on <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/whitecoat/communication/2010/10/01/social-medicine/ \" target=\"_blank\">CBC’s White Coat Black Art Show </a>, <a href=\"http://www.10tv.com/live/content/video/10tv.html?video=1167184 and http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/aug/12/high-tech-house-call-01362-vi-18537/\" target=\"_blank\">NPR, local television news </a>, <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxColumbus-Jennifer-Shine-Dye\" target=\"_blank\">TEDx Columbus</a> 2010, <a href=\"http://mobihealthnews.com/8599/texting-imrpoves-type-1-diabetes-adherence/ \" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Health News</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2010/09/06/prl20906.htm\" target=\"_blank\">American Medical News</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.endocrinetoday.com/view.aspx?rid=70442\" target=\"_blank\">Endocrine Today</a>. However, I began to observe that the initial adherence improvement started to disappear after about 6 months among the initial pilot study population before the personalized automation app programming was completed.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: So you came up with your first app to solve that problem. Right?</strong></p><p>I hypothesized that although the SMS texting protocol I used was providing reminders or triggers, the patients still needed more. Per BJ Fogg’s <a href=\"http://www.behaviormodel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">behavior change model</a>, three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Trigger. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing. My initial SMS texting protocol was only using triggers. Therefore, I am now working in partnership with an Ohio health <a href=\"http://www.duethealth.com \" target=\"_blank\">mobile app developer</a> on the completion of a very exciting diabetes app based on BJ Fogg’s health behaviors model targeting improvement in daily glucose checks which I recently discussed at <a href=\"http://mobilehealth.org/speakers/jennifer-dyer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford’s Mobile Health Meeting </a>‘What Really Works’ in May 2011.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Please tell us about your current project. What’s your company called? What’s the product and how does it work?</strong></p><p>As an independent consultant with my own company EndoGoddess LLC, I am working with Ohio health mobile app developer <a href=\"http://www.duethealth.com \" target=\"_blank\">DuetHealth</a> of eProximiti on designing and implementing the above app as well as designing and implementing new apps for clients. In other words, DuetHealth creates apps for clients (health systems, doctors’ offices, insurance agencies) that connect patients with their doctors while providing quality information and/or motivational strategies as requested for specific disease processes. Because the software platform is based on the doctor-patient relationship, which is also the foundation of good quality healthcare, the company software is named ‘duet’. The diabetes app product is called ‘Duet EndoGoddess’ which will be available in August on iTunes. The app targets glucose checking 4 times per day as the desired behavior. Patients can plug their glucometers into their smartphone using a USB cord (the same equipment that they use to download their meters on their home computer). They will receive iTunes points monthly for purchasing songs based on their achievement of daily glucose checks which serves as a rewards feedback loop to promote daily glucose checks and consequently improved insulin adherence and diabetes control. We are speaking to several large insurance agencies for testing the app in a large population. The app also provides additional daily motivational graphics, targeted real-time notification of glucoses to desired recipients, original educational content and videos, text reminders featuring clinical goals for diabetes care between visits, and the ability to securely text the physician and members of a designated social network.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Can you tell us a little bit about your revenue model? How will you make money with the app?</strong></p><p>The app will be a free download. The money to pay for iTunes points will come from the patient’s designated support network [friends, family] who are willing to sponsor the patient for the year. The idea is similar to how charities such as the Susan G Komen race participants are sponsored by their friends and family to earn money for breast cancer research. According to the patient’s preference, a monthly progress report can be sent to their sponsors so that they can encourage and reward the patient for their hard work checking their blood sugars daily. It is our hope that insurance agencies and/or advertisers will see the value in the app’s ability to create better health and to prevent complications with diabetes thereby sustaining the revenue model long-term. As with most internet start-up companies, the primary monetary value is within the equity of the company and its ability to solve problems that then leads to investments by venture capitalists thereby allowing the company to grow and spread its value commercially. As <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/06/diabetes?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/dc/sugarrush\" target=\"_blank\">diabetes has increased worldwide </a>over the past 30 years, long-term solutions are critical.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: So considering the fact that you actually researched this topic, would it be correct to say that yours is one of the first evidence based apps out there?</strong></p><p>The idea is not new, but the implementation and execution to this level in diabetes and mHealth is new. There are a lot of apps for diabetes available in the app store but none that I am aware of that directly connect the patient and the doctor and their glucometer and a designated social network.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: The social part is especially interesting about your business model. You will need a lot of buy-in from all the stakeholders: patients, doctors, relatives, insurance companies. How are you going to get this?</strong></p><p>As you know, consumers already love mobile, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/flurry-time-spent-on-mobile-apps-has-surpassed-web-browsing/\" target=\"_blank\">apps are now used more than internet browsing</a>. Doctors really like mobile too. In fact, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/m8gvEH\" target=\"_blank\">doctors are heavy tech users</a> – early adopters for healthcare technology. In the wake of ACA healthcare reform and payment restructure that penalizes hospital readmissions, insurance companies and hospital systems are rewarding affordable and impactful innovations in quality healthcare such as mobile health. We have already received a lot of interest from insurance companies in using and testing our apps, and have implemented our f<a href=\"http://ow.ly/4zwFQ\" target=\"_blank\">irst duet module </a>at Ohio Health Hospital System in obstetrics with a lot of excitement amongst all parties. I feel that the future is bright for the doctor-patient relationship and its mobile extension!</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Are you the sole founder of your company or do you have partners?</strong></p><p>As an independent consultant, I am the sole founder of my company EndoGoddess LLC. I own a share of intellectual property in the Duet EndoGoddess diabetes app.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Do you already have funding?</strong></p><p>I have invested my personal savings to start my business and to make the transition from academics to entrepreneurship. Otherwise, I receive income from my primary client DuetHealth and am speaking to several other potential clients for further consulting work in healthcare social media.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: You are an avid user of Twitter. Can you explain your Twitter use-case to us? How are you making use of it?</strong></p><p>I also actively engage and speak nationally about healthcare social media including at the recent South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference in March 2011. I am known to many on twitter as @EndoGoddess and have a youtube channel which I use primarily for advocacy. I maintain social boundaries by using the same standards of professionalism followed by generations of doctors before the advent of the internet. I feel that ‘good health is social’ and that social media provides opportunities for physicians to connect people with authentic improvements in their wellbeing and health which far outweigh the easily-managed perceived risks.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: With all these distractions…Twitter, e-mail, Facebook and so forth, do you think social media is making people less happy, happier or do they have no influence on happiness levels – what do you think?</strong></p><p>For me, social media connects me with the reason that I became a doctor: patients. Helping patients empower themselves with knowledge and live their best lives is an absolute honor that gives me great happiness. As will all things, balance is key, and I do recommend taking periodic ‘digital vacations’ to assure that balance…this really works for me.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Before the interview, you told us that you are doing social media consulting. Could you tell us a little more about it?</strong></p><p>The primary part of my healthcare social media consulting involves advocacy and speaking at meetings.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: What is the best advice you got from a mentor or friend?</strong></p><p>Dream it then do it.</p><p><strong>MedCrunch: Thank you so much for your time!</strong></p><p><strong>Jennifer Shine Dyer, MD, MPH </strong>is a mobile health physician entrepreneur and consultant.

Stay tuned for more good stuff to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a title=\"Yammer\" href=\"https://www.yammer.com/\"></a></p><p><a title=\"Yammer\" href=\"https://www.yammer.com/\">Yammer</a> was coined the &#8220;<a title=\"Twitter for Companies\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2008/09/08/yammer-launches-at-tc50-twitter-for-companies/\">Twitter for Companies</a>&#8220;. It was launched a couple of years ago by seriel entrpreneur and movie producer <a title=\"David O Sacks\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks\">David O. Sacks</a> in the Silicon Valley, with the aim to build a web-based tool for internal communication in startups, SMBs and cooperations. Yammer is really powerful. It comes with a variety of mobile applications and a sound web interface, that let&#8217;s you manage yourself and your co-workers in groups, send direct messages and follow each other &#8211; much like Twitter.</p><p>The basic structure &#8211; it&#8217;s logic &#8211; is very similar to Twitter. In comparison to Facebook, Twitter is open, it&#8217;s not a walled garden. The &#8220;following&#8221; concept is more vague than the &#8220;be-friending&#8221; concept. Twitter allows you to follow people whom you do not know. Twitter is also better suited for sharing work-realted and professional information than Facebook, which was originally conceived to exchange personal information between friends. Imagine following the top-notch breast surgeon in the hospital you work at. Chances are high you don&#8217;t know her personally and she has no clue who you are, but what if she&#8217;d share valuable information on the latest insights in breast cancer reserach. She would share information you would be usually looking up in some journal or to be honest you might not even look it up and it might just pass you by.</p><p>An application such as Yammer solves this by connecting the unconnected. By following peers and certain people you&#8217;ll obtain knowledge and insights that you probably didn&#8217;t even know existed. A medical, multi-disciplinary approach, as medicine is being taught in med school, yet as it fails to be practiced in daily routine. Where specialists of all walks contribute their experience to a singular activity feed that anybody in the hospital environment can follow, react to and share with others. That&#8217;s social networking at its best, yet hardly anybody is doing it.</p><p>As with every good story in life, a similar, yet mor action-esque story took place <a title=\"Twitter in Greys Anatomy\" href=\"http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2011/02/027793.htm\">in a recent episode of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</a>. They were texting live status updates from the OR to another hospital and other medical professionals with the intention to document a live operation for othters to learn from. Eventually there were problems during the procedure and a life-saving-tweet from another professional saved the patient&#8217;s life. Well, this is Hollywood but not that unlikely after all &#8211; we think.</p><p>While Twitter has its limitations with respect to security, Yammer doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s secure, scalable and highly customizable. Yammer for your research group? Yammer for the OR? Yammer for your ward? No problem for Yammer. To clarify things here. We are not affiliated with Yammer or paid by them, it&#8217;s simple and we are not aware of a comparable, modern and efficient alternative to their service. Surely there are the SAPs, Siemens and others on the planet that offer such services for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but Yammer costs 1$ per user $5/user/month. That&#8217;s fair and an understandable pricing model.</p><p>We&#8217;d really like to see a hospital, or a ward, giving Yammer a try. Crossing the border of traditional communication and aiming for an alternate and potentially higher form of communication through the means of technology. What do you think about this matter? We would love to hear your ideas in the comments section.</p>','<p>Hospitals are like big corporations.

Diller, now 69, was said to excessively, make use of a concept known as &#8220;reverse mentoring&#8221;. As the title suggests, the idea is that the typically younger, less experienced person, who has knowledge in a particula area, gives advice to the more senior person. This works amazingly well in a setup with an executive such as Barry Diller. Jack Welch, Management-Guru und CEO of GE is also known for using a reverse mentored decision process.</p><p>He, the experience business person, with a track record in print publishing is being told that the company needs to move towards the internet to be sucessful. By asking the modern customer, the young, internet-savvy users, he gets insight into the market he wants to enter. It&#8217;s a great and simple concept as long as the senior to-be-mentored person shows humblness and willingness to learn from a less experienced person, which makes this more of a psychological obstacle, then an organizational one.</p><p>Does reverse mentoring have its raison d&#8217;être also in medicine? Are you aware of a such concepts &#8211; maybe even in the hospital or pharma company you are working at?</p><p>What could be a use case of this concept in a clincial seeting?</p><p>We&#8217;d be happy to hear more on this if you have experience with it.

Search companies like Google, in the business of providing the best search possible, like ways they can gauge the influence of content they index. Instead of pulling up content based on the most keywords or links similar to the query, they can filter out the more important content –that created by real influencers on the topic within the social internet. Businesses known as social ranking sites are compiling competitive rating systems with the ultimate goal of creating a number for influencers on particular topics. Ultimately, your number will be compared and contrasted to the numbers of other participants in the social sphere and count towards ratings that might be used for everything from ranking you on consumer sites like Amazon.com… to you and your businesses position in search engine rankings.</p><p>Why should you care? In the future it is probable that your social score will be available to everyone from banks to vendors. You will be able to learn things about the people you interview before you hire them and you better believe potential patients will look at it before deciding whether or not to patronize your business.</p><p>Remember when the most valuable currency on the internet was the domain name?</p><p>The social score is next.</p><p>The people involved early in the social internet will be the first to benefit. High social scores will be sought as will people who hold them. A corporation might seek out individuals with high social scores within their verticals with offers to promote products – a next-generation evolution of the Google Adsense concept.</p><p>The leader in calculating social influence, a website called <a title=\"Klout\" href=\"http://www.klout.com\">Klout.com</a> began integrating it’s “klout” ratings with data it compiled from Facebook in order to get a fuller picture of one’s efforts within the social sphere. It’s not done either – watch as they interface with LinkedIn, YouTube and a host of other popular social platforms to increase their influence as the leader in rating individuals social influence.</p><p>. . . and the first place “Klout” will be important is your search engine ranking. Tweets from the most authoritative tweeters are likely to make it to the top of search results first. How many people share the blog you post will count towards your total social score. Links shared by people with higher social scores will count more than links from those with lower scores. Keyword and key phrases placed in content, while important, will no longer be the gold standard in optimizing content. The biggest factor will be your participation in the important social suites, so I’m going to go out on a limb and try and coin a new phrase to live by in this strange new system – “Get Klout or you’re out.”</p><p>Sign up for Klout for free at http://www.klout.com To try it out, if you like the content I create on SEO or social media visit my profile <a title=\"Klout\" href=\"http://klout.com/#/EyeInfo\">http://klout.com/#/EyeInfo</a> and give me “+K”, Klouts version of “props” or “credit” for the topics one creates content around.

We are not speaking of the medical profession obviosuly but from all these things that you, as a human being in the civilized world are surrounded with. In med school and as a physician you are acting in a walled and exclusive garden. Why &#8220;exclusive&#8221; and &#8220;walled&#8221; you might ask, but let us explain this.</p><p>Do you think the average physician has any clue how the healthcare system really <em>works</em>? In our experience they don&#8217;t. Neither in med school, nor in residency you learn how the system is set up. How is the price of a drug being calculated? Who owns the hospital you are working at? Who pays your bills?</p><p>Obviously there are harsh differences between the US (private) and Europe (public) in terms of these questions but that doesn&#8217;t matter for this post. The argument we are posing referrs to the individual, not to the system. The question is, do <strong>YOU </strong>know anything about the system you are working in? But let&#8217;s take a step back. Have you ever learned anything about the economic and legal basics of life in med school? How do insurances work? What&#8217;s the best way to finance your car?</p><p>We agree, that this is not a problem of medicine alone, but also has its presence in other walks such as physics or software development. If you ever plan to open up your own office then you&#8217;ll ultimately will have to deal with these things. With loans, with banks, with insurances, with salespeople, with pharma reps and the list goes on forever.</p><p>One thing that is absurdedly not being taught in med school is <a title=\"How to treat pharmaceutical companies\" href=\"http://www.medcrunch.net/pharma-marketing-101-two-things-pharma-needs-from-you/\">how to treat pharmaceutical companies</a>. The pharma industry is by far the biggest &#8220;sparring partner&#8221; of the modern physician, yet we are never thaught how to interpret their sales material. We are wow&#8217;ed by fancy presentations, hockey stick survival rate charts and beautiful print folders, but although we were taught to question science and its results, we were never taught  how to interpret results being presented by pharma companies and how to interact with sales people.</p><p>Yet these things are vital. They are as important as knowing the current guidelines in your respective field of work. Understanding the system you are working in, allows you to question it and eventually also to tweak it. There&#8217;s a saying that goes like this: &#8220;Those who do not know, must believe&#8221;.

Apart from the obvious (negative) health implications, it is much less socially accepted than in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtMfzasLbu8\" target=\"_blank\">the golden days</a>. Now there are great minds out there that see great opportunities, but it&#8217;s uncommon that you stumble upon a company that aims to re-invent smoking. &#8220;Re-inventing&#8221; is somewhat of an oxymoron. It simply doesn&#8217;t fit in our minds and seems so wrong especially when it has to do with something that harmful. There are two major reasons why cigarettes (for the sake of simplicity and correlation of worldwide usage let&#8217;s leave out pipes, sishas et al.) have been (and still are in some parts of the world) such a tremendously successful product.</p><p>1. They are highly addictive</p><p>2. They were widely regarded as something &#8220;cool&#8221; (mostly through the entertainment industy)</p><p>Being addicted and killing yourself isn&#8217;t something worth striving for &#8211; being &#8220;cool&#8221;, however, is  for a lot of people, especially young ones. Now what if you could eliminate the &#8220;health part&#8221; of the whole smoking paradigma? Plenty of companies, entrepreneurs and chemists have tried to do so, but largely failed. Part of the reason is that the &#8220;cool&#8221; part has been neglected. It&#8217;s hard to imagine Jon Hamm in Mad Men smoking an electronic cigarette. It&#8217;s not authentic, it&#8217;s fake, it&#8217;s not cool.</p><p>Step into <a title=\"Ploom\" href=\"http://www.ploom.com\" target=\"_blank\">PLOOM</a> - a blend of <a title=\"Nespresso\" href=\"http://www.nespresso.com/\">Nespresso</a> and Cigarettes:</p><p>Ploom began as a conversation between a smoker and a non-smoker outside a studio at Stanford’s Joint Program in Design in 2004.</p><p>&#8220;What do you hate about smoking?&#8221; Adam asked.<br /> &#8220;What do you love about it?&#8221; James responded.</p><p>The two had already been collaborating on eccentric thesis explorations but those were quickly dropped to answer the question: What if smoking were reinvented today? The thesis generated support from some of the most well respected thinkers and doers in and around the University. James and Adam founded Ploom in a tiny orange painted room on an apple orchard in Palo Alto, determined to bring a better alternative to people who love (and hate) smoking. Hundreds of prototypes, consumer insights and a business plan later, the two developed a unique startup in the historic Dogpatch area of San Francisco with a handful of the best engineers, advisors, marketing and biotech veterans in the country. The model One and Ploom’s first six flavors are the first glimpse of the future of smoking: a new ritual for a modern society from a new kind of company.</p><p>Ploom is a company that takes into account that smoking has been a social habit for thousands of years. It&#8217;s always been there, and before modern medicine has stepped in, it also hadn&#8217;t been regarded as something bad or unhealthy. The San Francisco based startup doesn&#8217;t aim to offer an alternative for the modern nicotine addict, but rather offers a viable, <a title=\"Ploom FAQ\" href=\"http://ploom.com/faq.html\" target=\"_blank\">harmless</a> and cool smoking device. Why not smoke if it doesn&#8217;t harm your body, doesn&#8217;t affect your surrounding and doesn&#8217;t make your clothes smell? What if the aspartam in diet coke was more health-threatening than a cigarette?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.medcrunch.net/smoking-beautifuland-harmless/\"><em>Click here to view the embedded video.</em></a></p><p>The endavour of the two founders Adam and James is an ambitious one, but it&#8217;s simply amazing that in the eco-friendly, Toyota Prius® covered Dogpatch area of San Francisco somebody really wants to make smoking cool again.

Interestingly, you won&#8217;t see the same irritated faces if you had studied business and wanted to leave accounting or even law and wanted to quit being an attorney &#8211; but that&#8217;s another matter. People expect you to be working in the field of work you were educated in &#8211; and that&#8217;s not good. In most European countries you have to decide which education you want to pursue at the age of 18. Seriously, at the age of 18, where you have drinks, fun and girls or guys in mind, you have to think about such a crucial and long-lasting decision &#8211; that&#8217;s ridiculous. With the American college and grad-school system in education the &#8220;point of no return&#8221; gets pushed back some years, yet still it doesn&#8217;t solve the basic problem of (too) early decisions. When you start going to med school you probably have a certain picture in mind of what a doctor does. Of what medicine entails and what the ramifications of med school are. Statistically your dad or mom is a physician. If you eventually decide to pursue a medical career, during the first several years (typically pre-med), NO-BO-DY never, ever actually tells you what it&#8217;s like to work in a hospital (i.e., what it feels like). You study the basics of chemistry and pathophysiology, but you&#8217;ll never hear about work hours, compensation and how the insurance system works.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a rant against medical school or being a physician. It&#8217;s rather supposed to be tiny pamphlet that deciding too early in your life what you want to do for the rest of it might not be very wise. It&#8217;s also important to always remember that it&#8217;s never to late to switch. This sounds cheesy, but it&#8217;s true.</p><p>A colleague of ours went to med school, then went into pharma until he became medical director of a big pharma company and then decided to start a residency in oncology. It may look awkward starting your residency at the age of 45, but this guy knew everything about the pharma business. He was able to pull in research money easily, he knew a lot about clinical trials, about governmental limitations, transnational studies and epidemiology. His expertise must have been great for the other residents there. We love such &#8220;against the current&#8221; people and careers.

These are connected by cables to a machine which has the combined functions of an ECG display screen and the electrical function of a defibrillator. A synchronizing function (either manually operated or automatic) allows the cardioverter to deliver a reversion shock, by way of the pads, of a selected amount of electric current over a predefined number of milliseconds at the optimal moment in the cardiac cycle which corresponds to the R wave of the QRS complex on the ECG. Timing the shock to the R wave prevents the delivery of the shock during the vulnerable period (or relative refractory period) of the cardiac cycle, which could induce ventricular fibrillation. If the patient is conscious, various drugs are often used to help sedate the patient and make the procedure more tolerable. However, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable or unconscious, the shock is given immediately upon confirmation of the arrhythmia. When synchronized electrical cardioversion is performed as an elective procedure, the shocks can be performed in conjunction with drug therapy until sinus rhythm is attained.

We&#8217;ve also argued to some extent the model is dead. Pharma reps are expensive and pharma has transitioned into a sales business, rather than a research-driven business (some would argue that it has always been that way). The model of a pharmaceutical representative that visits the doc frequently and informs/pitches the physician about the drug is salesy and pushy. But what doctors really need is a partner. The company that produces the drug should know best about the drug. About it&#8217;s real efficacy, its side effects and its off- and on-label use. The rep should be a person the doctor can call anytime and ask questions he doesn&#8217;t find in the package leaflet. But although pharamceutical companies try do to so, many doctors still bolt when they see a pharma rep approaching. Not another brochure, not another free pen, not another salesman that wants me to prescribe more of the drug.</p><p>Now something called eDetailing has emerged over the past years. The idea is to bring old-fashioned drug brochures to life with multimedia presentations that are being distributed via e-mail or newsletter. Another approach is so-called TeleDetailing, where the acutual sales rep is behind a computer and hooks up with the doc over a video conferencing tool. Now this is primarly due to cost-cutting efforts of pharmaceutical companies, but they also envision to bring a closer and long lasting relationship with the physician.</p><p>Having a personal visit from a rep though shows that the doctor is being treated as important, that the company cares about her and takes time. On the other hand it can be time consuming, inefficient and repetitive.</p><p>Eventually there must be something in between. We do not have an answer and a lot of smart people out there have already put a lot of thought into this, but what&#8217;s really the best way that a pharma company approaches and pitches doctors without being annoying? It&#8217;s certainly handy to pull up a nifty flash animation that gives you all the background information about a drug, but it&#8217;s certainly also nice to have a person visiting you over decades, a person that accompanies your life as a physician.</p><p>Our guess is that in the long run there will be a distinction between physicians. This is already happening but not to such an obvious extent. Important physicians (so-called KOLs alias Key Opinion Leaders) will always be visited by real people. Young residents that hustle through the corridors with little income will likely be contact via digital channels. But the goal must be to access the doctor in a pull &#8211; and not a push &#8211; way. Meaning that the doctor should make use of a service or product that helps her in her daily clinical routine (i.e., physicians should ideally be the ones who &#8220;pull&#8221; the information from the pharma company).

Participants who were provided cost information also saved about $100 more per year. \"Our results suggest that comparison friction can be large even when the cost of acquiring information is small, and may be relevant for a wide range of public policies that incorporate consumer choice\" (Kling et. al., September 2011). </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2011/09/12/hlthaff.2011.0245.abstract\">Health Affairs</a>: Today\'s Meaningful Use Standard For Medication Orders By Hospitals May Save Lives; Later Stages May Do More &ndash; The federal government has an incentive program for hospitals and doctors that meet standards for the \"meaningful use\" of electronic health record systems. This study&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;a patient&rsquo;s first 30 days of being hospitalized for heart attacks, heart failure or pneumonia&mdash;the most common hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries--to evaluate the relationship between electronic medication orders and mortality.&nbsp;The authors report that \"the initial meaningful-use threshold for hospitals&mdash;which requires using electronic orders for at least 30 percent of eligible patients&mdash;is probably too low to have a significant impact on deaths from heart failure and heart attack among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. However, the proposed threshold for the next stage of the program&mdash;using the orders for at least 60 percent of patients, a rate some stakeholders have said is too high&mdash;is more consistently associated with lower mortality\" (Jones et. al., 9/15).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/31100557546u640n/\">Clinical Orthopaedics And Related Research</a>: Are African American Patients More Likely To Receive A Total Knee Arthroplasty In a Low Quality Hospital? &ndash; This study tries to determine if black Medicare patients seeking a knee replacement surgery were more likely to go to a hospital that had a high risk of post-surgery complications or death. The researchers devised a measure of hospital quality and then looked at racial trends for knee replacements. They found&nbsp; that 8 percent of African American patients were treated in high-quality hospitals, compared to 9.2 percent of white patients.

Uncertainties are greatest in the first few years after approval and for drugs approved solely on the basis of a surrogate outcome,\" the authors note. Yet a survey of nearly 3,000 people&nbsp;found that 39 percent believe the FDA approves only \"extremely effective\" drugs and a quarter of the participants said it approved only drugs without serious side effects.

J INVASIVE CARDIOL 2011;23:E219   E221 __________________________________ Case Report. A 55-year-old European female presented to our emergency department with 4-day history of fatigue, exertional shortness of breath, and dizziness. She denied any history of chest pain. She was a current 30 pack-year smoker with otherwise no significant past medical history or cardiac risk factors. Examination was unremarkable except for a bradycardia at 39 bpm. ECG showed a 3 to 1 second-degree AVB with significant ST elevation in the inferior leads and reciprocal depression in the lateral leads (Figure 1). TnT was 3.26   g/L (0   0.03   g/L). A diagnosis of late presentation inferior STEMI with heart block was made. She was relatively asymptomatic and was admitted into the coronary care unit and managed conservatively with close observation via telemetry. Approximately 12 hours following presentation, while remaining asymptomatic at rest, she developed complete heart block (CHB). She remained hemodynamically stable and an urgent temporary pacing wire was inserted (Figures 2A and 2B). Diagnostic coronary angiogram revealed minor left coronary artery disease (CAD) with an occluded dominant right coronary artery (RCA) from the mid-section (Figure 3). Due to presence of CHB, we elected to open the lesion. The occlusion was successfully crossed with a 0.014\" Rinato (Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) wire without much difficulty and stented with a Xience V (Abbott Vascular) 2.75 x 28mm, overlapped distally by Xience V (Abbott) 2.5 x 15mm stents (Figure 4). [4]Approximately 8 hours following coronary intervention to the RCA, the patient went into a 2 to 1 second-degree AVB. By the next day, she was back in a sinus rhythm with first-degree AVB (Figure 2C). Her PR-interval continued to improve during her last 48 hours in the hospital. On discharge, her PR-interval was 220 milliseconds and her inferior ST-elevation had nearly resolved (Figure 5). The three-month follow-up ECG showed normal PR interval and an incomplete right bundle branch block pattern. Q waves were present in the inferior leads consistent with the recent inferior MI. [5]Discussion. The AV node is supplied from the posterior descending artery or posterior interventricular artery, a branch of the RCA in right-dominant individuals. Inferior myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by AVB occurs in approximately 6% to 13% of patients and is associated with poorer 1-3 prognosis.  Patients with significant AVB associated with acute inferior STEMI are expected to improve with primary angioplasty, thus, permanent pacemaker is 4 often not required as described in the ACC/AHA/HRS Pacemaker Guidelines.  In our case, however, the optimal management of CHB in the context of a stable patient with late presentation inferior STEMI (&gt;  72 H) has not been well described in the literature. The Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) suggested that there was no difference in hard clinical endpoints (mortality, reinfarction, class IV heart failure) between the medically managed group and the intervention group for persistent total occlusion of the infarct-related 5 coronary artery.  Of note, CHB was not addressed in this trial. European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2007) guidelines for cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy suggested that significant AVB associated with inferior STEMI is often expected to improve within 7 days and a pacemaker is recommended in patients with persistent 2 of 4 9/14/11 2:26 PM  Complete Heart Block in Late Presentation of Inferior ... http://www.invasivecardiology.com/print/2930 6 advanced second-degree heart block or CHB 14 days after the onset of inferior STEMI. [6]Ramamurthy et al described a patient who had chest pain associated with syncope and diagnosed with a late inferior STEMI and persistent CHB of greater than 10 days. After successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the blocked RCA, this patient returned to sinus rhythm.7 By contrast, our patient had no history of chest pain, thus, medical management was initiated on admission as per the OAT trial in the case of a late presentation STEMI. The presence of significant bradycardia with 3:1 AVB on admission was a concern. Furthermore, the presence of dynamic conduction changes evident on ECG during the course of 24 H of observation suggested a possible reversibility of the culprit coronary lesion. The patient was therefore considered for coronary intervention, despite the present guidelines not clearly recommending reperfusion strategies for MI-related conduction abnormalities. The successful outcome (quick resolution of CHB and avoidance of permanent pacemaker insertion) in our case suggests that coronary intervention may be a valid management strategy in late presentation inferior STEMI with associated high-grade AVB or CHB, even in the absence of clinical chest pain.

Methods and Results: We studied AMI patients from two acute coronary syndrome registries carried out in Kuwait in  2007 and 2004. We included 1872 and 1197 patients from the 2007 and 2004 registries, respectively. When compared  with 2004, patients from the 2007 registry had similar baseline clinical characteristics. In 2007 compared to 2004, during  the in-hospital period, patients with AMI received significantly more statins (94% vs. 73%%, p &lt;0.0001), Angiotensin  converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (70% vs. 47%, p &lt;0.001), and Clopidogrel  (38% vs. 4%, p &lt;0.001), while beta-blockers use dropped in 2007 compared to 2004 (63% vs. 68%, p=0.0066). The rates  of in-hospital mortality and recurrent ischemia were significantly lower in the 2007 cohort compared with the 2004 cohort  (for mortality 2.2% vs. 3.9%, P=0.0008, for recurrent ischemia 13.7% vs. 20.4%, P=0 &lt;0.0001).Higher utilization of an- giotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and statins were the main contributors to the im- proved in-hospital mortality and morbidity.   In Conclusion: In the acute management of AMI, there was a significant increase in the use of statins, ACE inhibitors and  Clopidogrel in 2007 compared to 2004. This was associated with a significant decrease in the in-hospital mortality and re- current ischemia. Adherence to guidelines recommended therapies improved in-hospital outcomes.
